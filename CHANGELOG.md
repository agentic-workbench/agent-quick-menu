## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `/menu` pane with one section per plugin: its commands as buttons and its `userConfig` settings as a label/value table.
- Claude Code's own settings in a "Claude Code" section; managed-policy rows are locked.
- A one-line band above the prompt with favourites, digit hotkeys `1` to `9` on an empty prompt, and `ctrl+x tab` to focus it.
- Favourites (`☆` / `★`), foldable sections with `Expand all` / `Collapse all`, and a filter field.
- `.claude-plugin/quick-menu.json` convention with a JSON schema, and a "Problems" list for skipped files.
- `/menu refresh` and background discovery after `session.start`.
- Commands-only and settings-only sections for plugins without a menu file.
